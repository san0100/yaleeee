            <p>Story Time</p>
            <p>Every year, colleges receive a vast number of applications, leaving admission officers with limited time to thoroughly review each one. As a result, deserving students who may not have exceptional academic records, but possess other qualities essential for success, might be overlooked. Additionally, those with unique qualities that are not adequately highlighted may not achieve the desired outcome, which is acceptance.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-2" class="story-part">
            <p>In the president's office at Yale University, as the application season just ended, the Headmaster (President) and the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions gathered secretly to tackle that issue. Their goal is to find a special student whose story went beyond grades, someone who wouldn't just fit in but truly belong to the Yale Community.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-3" class="story-part">
            <p>The Headmaster, a fountain of wisdom much like Dumbledore, spoke with genuine passion, "This year, let's make it extraordinary. We're not just after numbers we're in search of the quintessential Yale wizard or witch, someone whose story weaves through experiences, passions, and dreams. We seek the kind of magic that goes beyond mere tests, someone destined to cast a unique spell on our campus, truly making it their home.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-4" class="story-part">
            <p>The Dean, nodding like Professor McGonagall, agreed, "Definitely we're looking for someone who can add their own special magic to Yale and become a unique part of our community.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-5" class="story-part">
            <p>In a moment of inspiration, much like a sudden burst of magic, the Headmaster suggested involving their mystical mascot, Handsome Dan, in the quest. "Let's send our Dan on a mission to explore the applications, seeking out the student whose tale aligns with the very spirit of Yale. A chosen one, not just academically, but someone who will truly thrive here."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-6" class="story-part">
            <p>In a cozy office meeting, the Dean entrusted the Handsome Dan with this special task, saying, "Dan, our wise companion, you're on a quest. Dive into those applications, and let's find the student whose journey goes beyond mere grades and test scores, like a brilliant mind with the touch of Hermione's intelligence or someone akin to Harry Potter's exceptional spirit. Look for passion, unique stories, and a magic that will truly thrive here. Once you spot them, send me a message, and we'll welcome them with open arms."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-7" class="story-part">
            <p>And so, the Handsome Dan embarked on its quest, its metaphorical paws treading through the narratives of applicants. It journeyed through the tales, searching for the spark of brilliance, the touch of unique intelligence, much like a story woven with the magic reminiscent of Harry Potter and the insightful brilliance of Hermione Granger.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-8" class="story-part">
            <p>After days of tireless searching and utilizing its magical instincts, the Handsome Dan finally uncovered someone whose story shimmered with a unique brilliance. Without a moment's hesitation, it sent a discreet message to the Dean through a secret messenger, heralding the arrival of a student who not only met the academic standards but resonated deeply with the spirit of Yale University.</p> 
            </div>

            <div id="part-9" class="story-part">
                <p>The excitement on campus was palpable as everyone eagerly anticipated discovering the identity of the student chosen by the Dan. The secret remained well-guarded among the Dean, the President (Headmaster), and the Handsome Dan. Whispers of curiosity floated through the halls, with some claiming they had found a way to unveil the hidden message in the secret messenger.</p>
